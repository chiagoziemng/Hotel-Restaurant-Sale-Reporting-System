Here are some detailed gathered requirements and needs for the sale reporting system for a Nigerian hotel based in Abuja

    Sales tracking:
    The system will have a module for tracking sales made at the hotel restaurant. The module will be designed to capture sales data, including the date and time of the sale, the amount of the sale, and the items sold. The module will also generate daily, weekly, and monthly sales reports. The data will be stored in a database and accessed using Django ORM.

    Inventory management:
    The system will have a module for managing inventory levels. The module will be designed to track inventory levels, alert staff when inventory is low, and generate reports on inventory levels. The module will also be able to update inventory levels when sales are made. The data will be stored in a database and accessed using Django ORM.

    Security:
    The system will be designed to ensure that customer data and financial information are secure. The system will use HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the user's browser and the server. The system will also implement user authentication and access control, to ensure that only authorized users can access the system. Passwords will be stored in hashed format to ensure that they cannot be easily compromised.

    User-friendly interface:
    The system will have a user-friendly interface that is easy to use and navigate. The interface will be designed to be responsive and optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices. The interface will be designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and will use the Django template engine to render dynamic content.

    Accessibility:
    The system will be designed to be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. The system will be optimized for use on different screen sizes and resolutions. The system will also be designed to be compatible with assistive technologies, such as screen readers, to ensure that users with disabilities can access the system.

    Customizable reporting:
    The system will have a module for generating customizable reports. The module will allow users to select different data points and time periods to generate reports. The module will also allow users to export reports in different formats, such as CSV or PDF. The data will be stored in a database and accessed using Django ORM.

Overall, the system architecture will be designed to ensure that the system is reliable, scalable, and secure. The system will be built using best practices in software engineering, including test-driven development and modular code design.


Based on the gathered requirements for the sale reporting system, the system architecture can be defined as follows:

    Front-end:
    The system will have a web-based user interface that will allow hotel staff to enter sales information, manage inventory, and generate reports. The user interface will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the Django template engine used for rendering dynamic content. The front-end will be responsive and optimized for use on desktop and mobile devices.

    Back-end:
    The system will be built using the Django web framework, which is a Python-based framework. The back-end will consist of the following components:

    Database: The system will use a relational database management system, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, to store data.
    Django ORM: The Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) will be used to interact with the database.
    Views: The views will handle user requests and return responses based on the request type.
    Models: The models will represent the data structures that will be stored in the database.
    URLs: The URLs will map user requests to the appropriate view function.

    Overall, the system architecture will be designed to ensure that the system is reliable, scalable, and secure. The system will be built using best practices in software engineering, including test-driven development and modular code design.

Sure, let's begin with the backend design for the hotel restaurant sale reporting system.

    Database:
    The first step in building the backend is to design the database schema. Based on the requirements, we can define the following tables:

    Sales: This table will store information about each sale, including the sale ID, date and time, the total sale amount, the payment method, and the staff member who made the sale.
    Menu Items: This table will store information about each menu item, including the item ID, name, price, and the category it belongs to.
    Inventory: This table will store information about each item in the inventory, including the item ID, name, quantity, and reorder level.
    Staff Members: This table will store information about each staff member, including their ID, name, email, and password.

We can use a relational database management system such as PostgreSQL or MySQL to implement the database.

    Django ORM:
    Once we have defined the database schema, we can use Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to interact with the database. We can define models for each of the tables, and use the ORM to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database.

    Views:
    Next, we need to define views to handle user requests. We can define views for adding new sales, viewing sales reports, managing inventory, and managing staff members. Each view will handle a specific type of request, and will return an appropriate response.

    URLs:
    To map user requests to the appropriate view, we need to define URLs. We can define URLs for each of the views, and use Django's URL routing system to map URLs to views.

    Authentication and Authorization:
    To ensure that only authorized users can access the system, we need to implement authentication and authorization. We can use Django's built-in authentication system to authenticate users, and implement access control using Django's permission system.

    Third-party Libraries:
    To enhance the functionality of the system, we may use third-party libraries and packages. For example, we may use the Django Rest Framework to build a RESTful API for the system, or we may use the Django Filters library to enable filtering of sales reports.

Overall, the backend architecture will be designed to ensure that the system is reliable, scalable, and secure. The backend will be built using best practices in software engineering, including test-driven development and modular code design.
